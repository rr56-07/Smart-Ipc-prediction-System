# Smart-Ipc-prediction-System
Assigning the correct Indian Penal Code (IPC) section to a First Information Report (FIR) is a vital step in legal processing. Traditionally, this classification relies on the judgment of police officers or legal personnel, which may lead to inconsistencies, especially under high workload or limited expertise. As the volume of FIRs continues to increase, there is a growing need for intelligent systems that can automate this task reliably.
With advancements in natural language processing, transformer-based models like TinyBERT and DistilBERT have shown remarkable performance in understanding context and semantics within text. These models can be trained to read FIR case descriptions and predict the most appropriate IPC section with high accuracy. This project utilizes a balanced dataset covering 409 IPC sections to fine-tune these models for legal text classification.
The goal is to support faster, more consistent, and scalable charge identification by reducing manual effort and improving legal accuracy. The proposed system can be integrated into police portals, legal chatbots, or digital FIR filing systems to enhance overall efficiency and support real-time IPC section recommendation.
